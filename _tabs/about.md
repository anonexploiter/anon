<span class="intro">Hey there fellow developers! My name is Surendar and I'm an Infosec student who loves nothing more than diving into the world of Python and networking. When I'm not busy hitting the books, you can find me competing in Capture the Flag (CTF) events or tinkering with front-end development. I'm also a security researcher at heart, always on the lookout for the next big vulnerability to uncover. Let's connect and geek out over all things tech!</span>
